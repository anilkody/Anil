        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Anil, a BTech student in Computer Science and
          Engineering. I love nothing more than bringing my ideas to life by
          creating web applications. I always strive to improve my skills and
          stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Being a developer is not
          just a job for me, it's my passion. I am excited to share my portfolio
          website with you, showcasing my work and abilities. Let's create
          something amazing together!
